Love Compatibility Calculator

A simple Python program that calculates the love compatibility score between two people based on the letters in their names.
Features:
•	Calculates compatibility based on the count of letters in "TRUE" and "LOVE" found in the combined names.
•	Provides a compatibility score and a message indicating the quality of the relationship.
•	Interactive input to check compatibility for multiple couples in one run.
•	Easy to understand and extend.

How It Works:
The program counts the occurrences of the letters T, R, U, E and L, O, V, E in both names combined.
Then it combines these counts into a score and outputs a compatibility message based on that score.
For example, if the total count of "TRUE" letters is 4 and "LOVE" letters is 2, the compatibility score is 42.

Usage:
1.	Run the program.
2.	Enter your name and your partner's name when prompted.
3.	View the compatibility score and message.
4.	Optionally, choose to check another couple.
